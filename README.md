The ‘Persona App’ contains many individual functions such as:

1.	‘Location Geocoding’: This uses Google Maps. The user can search for any location, with the location names typed in the ‘Search’ field. The function is such that, just typing ‘Mission Coll’, it will understand to locate ‘Mission College’ in Santa Clara. This implements the concept of Geocoding.
2.	‘Search’: This takes the user to Google Search so that he/she can look for anything on the internet.
3.	‘Alarm Clock’: This is a custom alarm clock created, where the user can set the alarm clock for any time, and it will give a notification message ‘Time to wake up’ in the mobile phone’s lock screen.
4.	‘Fall Detector’: This will detect a person if he/she falls down and will either call the person whose mobile number is set in the app or message that person if it detects the user fell down.
5.	‘Sleep Aid’: It will give an alert along with vibration to remind the user to sleep whenever it detects a movement while the person is sleeping. This has been created as a sleep aid to help the user to sleep.
